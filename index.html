						<h1 class="a">*My Short Back Story*</h1>
						<br /><br />
						<br /><br />
						<h1 class="b"> I started to study at school when Iâ€™m 4 years old. I graduated from Kinder garden at gwadal canal kinder garden. I graduated in Elementary school at the age of 10 year old in San Juan elementary school. At this point I started to work before I goto school. Every morning I goto Lola Pining house to care take her Elder Brother I wash him, I put cloth on him, I cook food for him after that he will give me money 50 pesos and goto school, after school Everyday I always walk to save money for my project even though it's so far, when I got home I will going to supermarket to buy ingredients for our food stall, we sale kwek-kwek, fishball, kikiam, lumpia, etc. Yes it's tiring but we don't have a choice because we are poor, many year past many challenges & changes comes but still my family remain still strongly together. fast forward I graduated in Junior high school in Maceda Integrated School. And I graduated in Senior High school on Divine Grace Montessori Rosales Pang. And currently a College student in Urdaneta City University. 
						
						I will say that I m the one who has big dream. I always trying my best to reach and to achieve my goals and dreams. But sometimes my lazyness always try to destroy my spirit and motivation. One of my weakness is I am not a person got a self confidence and also my family, Iâ€™m very shy in front of many people itâ€™s makes me so nervous. Do I decided to show my inspirational thoughts through the words. 
        
         Iâ€™m afraid what people say to me, and Iâ€™m afraid to be judge by doing wrong thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m shy of everything. When I was I little child, I always say to my parents that when I grow up I will going to be a successful son, I want to makes my parents, siblings to be happy I want to provide there needs and wants, Iâ€™m sure I can say that Iâ€™m smart but not totally smart,  Iâ€™m friendly, and Iâ€™m a creative boy. I always do something that I want and I try new things something different in order to grow and learn more. I always try to gave my best to myself and to my parents. I hope everything  that I want I wish  will achieved and granted to me in the near future. 
         
          My parents is my inspiration I want to pay there struggles there sacrifice in order for us there children to live,  I thanks God for giving me this wonderful parents I promise myself that I will build the best of me in order to be successful and for my parents to be proud of.
